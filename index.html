          <strong>7 million people</strong> <br />
          died as a result of air pollution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in
          households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. There are
          around 2.9 billion people around the world who live in homes with
          these kinds of stoves. Outdoor air pollution was linked to 3.7 million
          deaths in 2012.

          The health impacts of local air pollution, particularly from road
          transport, are much larger than previously thought.

          <h3>Drive less</h3>
          <p>
            Cars and trucks are one of the primary contributors of air
            pollution, due to the lead in petrol and nitrogen oxides from
            exhausts. Regularly choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport
            instead of driving will help to reduce air pollution.

          <h3>Change our industries</h3>
          <p>
            Many industrial processes create air pollution, which can easily be
            swept into cities and residential areas. Innovating industrial
            processes to use methods that release fewer particles and chemicals
            into the air will be beneficial to our health, and to the
            environment.

          <h3>Control bushfires</h3>
          <p>
            Bushfires are a natural cause of air pollution. While we cannot
            prevent all bushfires, we can reduce their risks by observing fire
            warnings and bans, removing fire hazards in our homes and gardens,
            and supporting efforts to reduce climate change.

            Support Outdoor air pollution can only be reduced by working
            together at local, national and global levels. Supporting products
            and policies that benefit our environment will ultimately benefit
            everyone.
